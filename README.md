# -Facial-Key-points-Detection  😁

Deep learning model based on `Convoluted Neural Network [CNN] ` and `Residual Blocks` is used to predict facial key-points.

Facial Key-Point Detection serves as a basis for Emotion AI applications like detecting customer emotional responses to Ads and in Driver Monitoring Systems.😁
